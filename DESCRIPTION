Title: Moderation Analysis for Two-Instance Repeated Measures Designs
Description: Multiple moderation analysis for two-instance repeated measures designs, with up to three simultaneous moderators (dichotomous and/or continuous) with additive or multiplicative relationship. Includes analyses of simple slopes and conditional effects at (automatically determined or manually set) values of the moderator(s), as well as an implementation of the Johnson-Neyman procedure for determining regions of significance in single moderator models. Based on Montoya, A. K. (2018) "Moderation analysis in two-instance repeated measures designs: Probing methods and multiple moderator models" <doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1088-6> .
