Title: Moderation Analysis for Two-Instance Repeated Measures Designs
Description: Multiple moderation analysis for two-instance repeated measures designs, with up to three simultaneous moderators (dichotomous and/or continuous) with additive or multiplicative relationship. Includes analyses of simple slopes and conditional effects at (automatically determined or manually set) values of the moderator(s). Based on Montoya, A. K. (2018) "Moderation analysis in two-instance repeated measures designs: Probing methods and multiple moderator models" <doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1088-6> .
